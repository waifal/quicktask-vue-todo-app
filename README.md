# QuickTask

I’m diving into JavaScript and Vue.js, starting with a simple but powerful project: a Todo List app. This project will help me practice my JavaScript basics (like working with arrays, functions, and handling events), while also gaining hands-on experience with Vue.js to build a dynamic, interactive app.

Through this project, I’ll learn to use Vue’s reactive features and components, while strengthening my understanding of JavaScript. It’s a perfect way to put what I’m learning into practice!

## To-Do

1. Add `styling` to the task items
2. Add interactive buttons to the task items (i.e., complete and delete)
3. Add `time/calendar` functionality
4. Add `reminder` functionality
5. Add `completion` tracking
6. Add `category` management
7. Add `search` functionality
8. Add `Web Storage API` to save tasks
9. Add `drag and drop` functionality to move tasks around
10. Change body `background-color`
11. Add `Responsive Web Design`

This web app was created with HTML, SCSS, JavaScript and Vue.js
